# Python Mini Projects

This repository contains my small Python practice projects to improve coding skills and build hands-on experience.  
Each mini project helps strengthen core Python concepts step by step.

## Projects

### 1. BMI Calculator
- Uses user input (height and weight) to calculate BMI and shows health status (underweight, normal, overweight).
- Includes error handling using try-except-finally to handle invalid inputs gracefully.

### 2. Student Management
- Manages student data using Python classes (name, age, grade).
- Prints all student information and allows filtering students with grade A.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to each project folder.
3. Run the Python file (e.g., `python bmi.py`) to try it out!
